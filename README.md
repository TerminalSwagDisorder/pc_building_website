Exploring a React.js Computer Configurator: Empowering Users to Customize PC Builds with Data Scraping and Database Integration. 
This project focuses on the development process of a custom computer configurator, a user-friendly web-based application that 
empowers users to create personalized computer systems. The project is composed of three core components: data scraping, dynamic 
web design, and database integration. 

The centerpiece of the project is the React.js website, which hosts the configurator's intuitive interface. Leveraging the dynamic 
capabilities of React.js, the website seamlessly interacts with the SQLite3 database, enabling users to select and customize individual 
components, resulting in their ideal computer setup. The integration of React.js and SQLite3 ensures optimal performance and efficient 
data retrieval.
